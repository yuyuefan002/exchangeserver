1.  RUN basic.sh to check server works or not(using nc, change hostname and port as you wish)
2.  RUN attck.sh to check whether there is a stack overflow problem
    (using nc, change hostname and port as you wish)
3.  MAKE GenerateXML program to do performance test
    There are two macro inside the main cpp to define the thread number and
    request per thread. The total running time will be output into output.txt
    Each time you run test output.txt will be overwritten.
    All requests are randomly generated, the total running time will vary a lot.
    This is because there is a lock on critical path on <order> while others not.
    When thread number is equal or larger than 200, the test program might be stuck.
