1.RapidXml use pointers to take values into node, therefore, the values should exist as long as the doc file.
2.I use lock to guard the match part to prevent new order match the current order.
3.When given a id to query, we should check whether this id is exist.
4.In the client code, we create an order and directly wait for it, so that we serialized our request
5.After we create a thread, we detach it. when main function end, all threads end no matter it ends or not.

Huge Test Problem:
In the first version of our testing function, there are several problems worth noting:
1. call thread.join() immediately after we create the thread, which means we only create a thread(make a request)
after we finish the previous one. Therefore we serialize our requests.
2. Using the multi-thread program described in 1., we run our test program on the same machine where sever runs.
We found a strange phenomenon, when we used 2 cores, we got the best performance. When we used 4 cores, we got the
worst performance. Why? It is contrast to our common sense. After we realizing the problem 1, we found a way to eaplain
problem 2. When we assigning 4 cores to server, there is no idle core for client program, therefore, client program must
scramble for resouces with server, which cause server run slower.


Performance Problem:
We came up with two solution:1.create thread per request 2. pre-create thread
Theoratically, the time to create thread will be in the critical path, therefore, the performance will not as good as pre-create thread.
However, in the actual situation, we didn't have a good implementation to solve the contention in pre-create thread. We used a queue to store
currect tasks, each thread would check this queue to fetch any available task. Std::queue is not a thread-safe data structure, therefore, we locked
the critical section(fetch the front of queue and pop it). According to the result, this part lead to a contension which made sever slow extremely.
Therefore, we are still using the first solution.
