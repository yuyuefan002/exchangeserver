1.RapidXml use pointers to take values into node, therefore, the values should exist as long as the doc file.
2.I use lock to guard the match part to prevent new order match the current order.
3.When given a id to query, we should check whether this id is exist.
4.In the client code, we create an order and directly wait for it, so that we serialized our request
5.After we create a thread, we detach it. when main function end, all threads end no matter it ends or not.
